## Installation

### Impatient? On OS X? Install from binary tarball.

To quickly get Switchboard up and running on Mac OS X, you can use a prebuilt
release. If you want to do a quick install (I recommend verifying the contents
of the URL):

    curl -sL "https://www.dropbox.com/s/hyu587h9cazlnc0/switchboard.tar.gz" | tar -xz && ./switchboard/bin/switchboard console

That was supposed to download, unpack, and start the application,
dumping you at the Erlang console. `switchboard/bin/switchboard` is the
startup/control script. You can run it without arguments to see its
many useful commands.

Because you won't be building the application, the client section of
[getting started](getting-started.md) will probably be most
interesting to you. Check out the Switchboard Erlang API or Example
Client section for directions on how to start fetching emails.


### From Source

Switchboard uses
[`extend/erlang.mk`](https://github.com/extend/erlang.mk) and
[`erlware/relx`](https://github.com/erlware/relx) to build and
package the application.

These instructions require `make` and `git` to be on your path, and an
installation of Erlang/OTP R16B03. I'll leave `make` and `git` to you,
but to install Erlang you can use Homebrew if you're on Mac OS X, else
check
[here](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/download-erlang-otp)
for the appropriate package/architecture and installation
instructions.

Now you can clone the project, build the application, package it into
a release, and start it.

{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://bitbucket.org/thusfresh/imapswitchboard switchboard
cd switchboard
# Make the release
make
# Start the application
./_rel/bin/switchboard start
# Check whether the application is running
./_rel/bin/switchboard ping  # -> ping

# Print more options, like stopping Switchboard
./_rel/bin/switchboard
{% endhighlight %}

Please create an issue if there were any problems.
