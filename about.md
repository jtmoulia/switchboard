## About

Switchboard open source project provides high level tools
for managing IMAP clients across email accounts and providers.
Itâ€™s aim is to free you from the plumbing of server-side email
handling, allowing you to focus on your products and services.

Switchboard was developed by Thomas Moulia in 2013 with the
sponsorship of [Spatch](http://spatch.co/), an innovative startup that
seeks to revolutionise the way email communication works. The decision
was driven by the belief that great things can be done to improve
email management and everybody should be free to do that without
constraints.


Switchboard remains and always will be a liberally licensed open source project.
People are welcome to contribute to Switchboard core and develop new
features as well as create all kinds of workers using the Switchboard client API.
